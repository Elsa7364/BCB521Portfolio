Data Identification and Justification\nDataset Chosen: Global YouTube Statistics 2023, from Kaggle\nThe dataset offers a detailed look at successful YouTube channels, tracking metrics like subscribers, views, and earnings. It’s great for studying issues in online media, like how a channel’s age impacts its follower count or if its earnings are linked to its home country’s unemployment rate.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDoes the unemployment rate in a country correlate with the earnings of YouTube channels originating from that area?\nHow is the rate of college enrollment in a country connected to the types of popular YouTube channels from that place?\nIs there a link between how urbanized a country is and the number of views its YouTube channels get?\n\nHypotheses:\nH1: There is a significant correlation between a country’s ‘Unemployment.rate’ and the ‘highest_yearly_earnings’ of YouTube channels based in that country.\nH2: Countries with higher ‘Gross.tertiary.education.enrollment’ rates will have more popular YouTube channels in the ‘Education’ category.\nH3: YouTube channels from countries with higher ‘Urban_population’ rates will have higher ‘video_views’.\n\n\n2.

This could be a placeholder or error. Since it’s an isolated case, it’s unlikely to significantly impact the overall analysis, but it should be acknowledged.\nAlso, the median of 17,700,000 in ‘subscribers’ suggests that half of the YouTubers have fewer subscribers than this number.\nEarnings display huge variability, ranging from zero to 16.34 million, which could be an intriguing focus for analysis.\nThere are 1291 missing values found across various variables in the dataset. This could affect the reliability of running any analyses or models.\nImmediate Steps:\n\nAddress missing data issues.\n\n\n#Bar chart for missing values\nmissing_values &lt;- sapply(youtube_data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\nbarplot(missing_values, main = \"Missing Values by Variable\", xlab = \"Variables\", ylab = \"Number of Missing Values\")\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider normalizing variables with large ranges for easier comparison.\n\n\n#Box plot for 'video.views', 'subscribers', and 'highest_yearly_earnings' (Before normalization)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\nWarning: package 'reshape2' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'tidyr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:reshape2':\n\n    smiths\n\nggplot(gather(youtube_data, variable, value, video.views, subscribers, highest_yearly_earnings), aes(x = variable, y = value)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot Before Normalization\")\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigate outliers, particularly in video views, subscribers, and earnings.\n\n\n#Outlier plot (for 'video.views')\nggplot(youtube_data, aes(x = \"\", y = video.views)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Outliers in Video Views\") +\n  ylab(\"Video Views\")\n\n\n\n#Outliers plot (for subscribers)\nggplot(youtube_data, aes(x = \"\", y = subscribers)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Outliers in Subscribers\") +\n  ylab(\"Subscribers\")\n\n\n\n#Outliers plot (for earnings)\n# Outliers plot (for highest_yearly_earnings)\nggplot(youtube_data, aes(x = \"\", y = highest_yearly_earnings)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Outliers in Highest Yearly Earnings\") +\n  ylab(\"Highest Yearly Earnings\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Data Description\n\nData Provenance\nThe dataset comes from multiple data sources, it was downloaded from Kaggle.\n\n\nData Collection\nThe data was gathered using Python, indicating that it was likely automated, potentially through application programming interface (API) which means the data was likely fetched directly from YouTube’s own set of APIs.\n\n\nData Dictionary\n• rank: Position of the YouTube channel based on the number of subscribers\n• Youtuber: Name of the YouTube channel\n• subscribers: Number of subscribers to the channel\n• video views: Total views across all videos on the channel\n• category: Category or niche of the channel\n• Title: Title of the YouTube channel\n• uploads: Total number of videos uploaded on the channel\n• Country: Country where the YouTube channel originates\n• Abbreviation: Abbreviation of the country\n• channel_type: Type of the YouTube channel (e.g., individual, brand)\n• video_views_rank: Ranking of the channel based on total video views\n• country_rank: Ranking of the channel based on the number of subscribers within its country\n• channel_type_rank: Ranking of the channel based on its type (individual or brand)\n• video_views_for_the_last_30_days: Total video views in the last 30 days\n• lowest_monthly_earnings: Lowest estimated monthly earnings from the channel\n• highest_monthly_earnings: Highest estimated monthly earnings from the channel\n• lowest_yearly_earnings: Lowest estimated yearly earnings from the channel\n• highest_yearly_earnings: Highest estimated yearly earnings from the channel\n• subscribers_for_last_30_days: Number of new subscribers gained in the last 30 days\n• created_year: Year when the YouTube channel was created\n• created_month: Month when the YouTube channel was created\n• created_date: Exact date of the YouTube channel’s creation\n• Gross tertiary education enrollment (%): Percentage of the population enrolled in tertiary education in the country\n• Population: Total population of the country\n• Unemployment rate: Unemployment rate in the country\n• Urban_population: Percentage of the population living in urban areas\n• Latitude: Latitude coordinate of the country’s location\n• Longitude: Longitude coordinate of the country’s location\n\n\n\n4. Next Steps\nTo make the dataset more reliable, I’ll either fill in or get rid of any missing values. For numbers that span a wide range, I’ll use some standardizing methods to make them easier to compare. I’ll also take care of any extreme values, or outliers, so they don’t throw off our analysis. And to make sure our findings are solid, I’ll set a specific siginificance level acting as a “passing grade” for our hypothesis tests. Then there will be advanced visualizations and interpretation."

    "text": "Initial Findings\nThe relationship between median income and other sectors has not been clearly established. For example, in examining the scatterplot of median income against domestic total self-supplied water use across U.S. counties, the data distribution lacks a linear pattern, suggesting that higher income does not necessarily correspond with greater domestic water usage.\n\nThe following scatterplot indicates there’s a clear upward trend showing that as population size increases, water use also goes up. This is shown in the way the data points line up in a straight line pattern, which is also highlighted by the blue line drawn through the data.\n\n\nAlthough a strong relationship between the variables has not been established, the following two plots offer a visual comparison, allowing a chance to see the geographic distribution of both domestic total use and household median income.\n\n\n\nObservations based on the maps\n\nThe water use map displays a wide range of differences among counties, with certain areas showing much higher or lower use than others. In contrast, the median income appears to be more evenly spread out over larger regions without such distinct variations.\nDespite no clear linear relationships in the previous scatterplots, certain regions, especially in the Northeast and parts of the West Coast, show a pattern where higher water use aligns with higher median incomes. This might mean that wealthier areas have greater water consumption, possibly because of larger homes or more water-demanding lifestyles. On the other hand, central areas of the country tend to have both lower water use and lower median incomes, which could relate to factors like less dense populations, different types of jobs, and varying access to water resources.\nIt is worth noting that the water use map uses quantiles, meaning it groups counties into categories that each contain the same number of places, which makes it easier to see relative high and low water use areas. The income map, using a continuous scale, reflects the actual income levels as they are, showing a more subtle and detailed picture. This approach for income might offer a deeper insight but could also make it harder to quickly identify where incomes differ greatly."
